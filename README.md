# SwiftShuaTi
Shuati in Swift

This is a command line app I hacked together to do ShuaTi in Swift.

ShuaTi in Chinese means 刷题, tranlated to "Iterating through coding problems brainlessly".

I've high hopes for this app to do more than just that.

=====================================================

Originally intended for simply Shuati, I'm consistently extending it to include more features, primarily on Swift language and algorithm experiements.

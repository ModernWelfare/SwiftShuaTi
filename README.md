# SwiftShuaTi
Shuati in Swift

This is a command line app I hacked together to do ShuaTi in Swift.

ShuaTi in Chinese means 刷题, tranlated to "Ploughing through coding problems".

I've high hopes for this app to do more than just that.

=====================================================

Originally intended for simply Shuati, I'm consistently extending it to include more features, primarily on Swift language and algorithm experiements.
